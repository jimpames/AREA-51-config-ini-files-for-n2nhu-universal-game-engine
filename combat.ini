[player_vs_grey_alien]
# Greys are not combat-optimized — they are scientists and diplomats
# But their telepathic defense is disorienting
base_damage = 10
weapon_multiplier = 1.0
can_attack = true
telepathic_disorientation = true
disorientation_chance = 0.3
disorientation_turns = 2
effect = loot_drop
message_hit = Your attack connects with the Reticulan. A wave of alien emotion washes over you — not pain, but something like profound disappointment at a frequency you feel in your skull. {damage} damage.
message_kill = The Reticulan Grey collapses, bioluminescent skin fading. You feel the echo of its final thought like a cold wind. You are not sure you feel good about this.

[player_vs_reptilian]
# Reptilians are armored security — damage resistance from natural scales
base_damage = 6
weapon_multiplier = 0.85
scale_armor_reduction = 5
can_attack = true
effect = loot_drop
message_hit = Your attack glances off the Reptilian's scaled hide, doing reduced damage. {damage} gets through.
message_kill = The Reptilian Commander falls with a sound like a collapsing building. Its amber eyes remain fixed on you even as the light in them dims. It did not expect to lose.

[player_vs_reptilian_commander]
# Boss fight — scale armor, regeneration, counterattack
base_damage = 5
weapon_multiplier = 1.3
scale_armor_reduction = 10
regeneration_rate = 5
can_attack = true
boss = true
effect = epic_loot
message_hit = You land a significant blow on the Reptilian Commander. It staggers — barely — and responds with a subsonic pulse that vibrates your bones. {damage} damage through the armor.
message_kill = Against probability and three distinct near-death experiences, the Reptilian Commander goes down. The craft around you dims momentarily, as if it is mourning. The amber artifact it carried rolls toward your feet.

[player_vs_mib]
# MIB are well-trained humans — no special resistances but aggressive
base_damage = 10
weapon_multiplier = 1.0
neuralytic_threat = true
can_attack = true
effect = loot_drop
message_hit = The MIB agent stumbles under your attack. The dark glasses stay on. Of course they do. {damage} damage.
message_kill = The MIB operative is down. His earpiece crackles. Someone somewhere is about to know this went wrong. You have limited time.

[player_vs_security_drone]

base_damage = 8
weapon_multiplier = 1.0
blunt_weapon_penalty = 0.5
energy_weapon_bonus = 2.0
can_attack = true
effect = loot_drop
message_hit = Your attack disrupts the drone's systems. Sparks and alien-blue light. {damage} damage.
message_kill = The drone drops from hover height and clatters to the floor, its targeting ring spinning down. Alien power cell visible in the wreckage.

[player_vs_hive_mind]
# The Collective Voice is a distributed consciousness — hard to damage physically
# But communicate verb can reduce hostility
base_damage = 4
weapon_multiplier = 0.6
energy_weapon_bonus = 1.5
telepathic_resistance = 50
communication_reduces_hostility = true
boss = true
effect = epic_loot
message_hit = Physical attacks achieve partial effect against the Collective Voice — its distributed nature absorbs most damage. {damage} registers, barely. Consider whether combat is the right approach.
message_kill = The Collective Voice disperses with a final telepathic broadcast that you will not be able to put into words for years afterward. The gist is: we misjudged the timeline. The star map settles to the floor.

[grey_attack_telepathic]
# Greys attack telepathically — confusion and disorientation
base_damage = 20
effect = disorientation
disorientation_duration = 3
message = The Reticulan's attack is not physical — it is a direct neural interrupt. Your vision whites out, your proprioception scrambles, and for three turns you will struggle to take purposeful action. It hurts less than it disorients.

[reptilian_attack_physical]
# Reptilians attack with raw physical force
base_damage = 40
effect = knockdown
knockdown_chance = 0.4
message = The Reptilian's blow connects with the force of something not quite biological. You are knocked back. The wall stops you. That's {damage} damage and a strong suggestion to reconsider your tactical position.

[reptilian_commander_attack_combo]
# Commander uses plasma weapon AND physical assault
base_damage = 60
effect = burning
burning_duration = 3
burning_damage_per_turn = 10
message = The Reptilian Commander fires the plasma weapon and follows through with a physical strike simultaneously. {damage} damage plus burning. Three turns of plasma residue damage. You are having a bad time.

[mib_neuralytic_attack]
# MIB can attempt to use the neuralytic scrambler
base_damage = 15
effect = amnesia
amnesia_chance = 0.2
amnesia_items_dropped = 1
message = The MIB agent deploys the neuralytic scrambler. The flash is intense. Most of your memories remain intact, but one item you were carrying... you look down. Gone. You had something there. You cannot remember what.

[drone_targeting_attack]
# Drones use focused energy beam
base_damage = 30
effect = electronics_disruption
electronics_disruption_duration = 2
message = The security drone's targeting beam connects. {damage} damage plus a localized electromagnetic pulse — any electronics you're carrying are disrupted for two turns.

[hive_mind_telepathic_assault]
# Collective Voice uses full telepathic broadcast
base_damage = 75
effect = total_disorientation
disorientation_duration = 5
message = The Collective Voice stops communicating and starts overwhelming. Every thought you have is interrupted, overwritten, redirected. {damage} damage. You are unable to take purposeful action for five turns. This is not recommended as a combat approach.
