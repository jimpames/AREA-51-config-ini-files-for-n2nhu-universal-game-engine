[element115_energize]
# Inert Element 115 sample inserted into the reactor cradle becomes energized
object_id = element_115_sample
state = inert
location_has_property = contains_reactor
turns_required = 5
new_state = energized
new_object_id = energized_115
message = The Element 115 sample pulses faster and faster in the reactor cradle. The amber light intensifies until the room is bathed in warm gold. With a deep subsonic THUMP felt in your sternum, the core achieves full energization. Gravitational waves wash across the chamber. You now hold an energized Element 115 core.

[energized_115_discharge]
# Energized 115 used to power a craft depletes over time
object_id = energized_115
state = energized
turns_required = 30
new_state = inert
new_object_id = element_115_sample
message = The energized Element 115 core has discharged to inert state. Its amber pulse has slowed to almost nothing. It will need to be recharged in the reactor to be useful again.

[power_cell_discharge]
# Charged alien power cell depletes when powering active devices
object_id = alien_power_cell
state = charged
turns_required = 20
new_state = depleted
new_object_id = depleted_power_cell
message = The alien power cell's amber vein dims and then goes dark. The device it was powering loses function. You'll need to recharge the cell in the Element 115 reactor.

[power_cell_recharge]
# Depleted power cell recharged in the reactor
object_id = depleted_power_cell
state = depleted
location_has_property = contains_reactor
turns_required = 8
new_state = charged
new_object_id = alien_power_cell
message = The depleted power cell absorbs energy from the reactor field. The amber vein brightens steadily over several minutes until the cell is fully charged again.

# TELEPORTATION VIA FLYING SAUCER
# ============================================================

[sport_model_launch_zeta]
# Sport Model craft launches when energized 115 + power cell are inserted and destination is Zeta Reticuli
object_id = sport_model_controls
state = destination_zeta
location_has_property = contains_sport_model
requires_object = energized_115
requires_object_2 = alien_power_cell
turns_required = 1
new_state = in_transit
new_location = zeta_reticuli_homeworld
message = You insert the energized Element 115 core into the Sport Model's reactor interface. The craft responds instantly — a deep harmonic vibration builds through the entire hangar, the floor itself resonating. You barely have time to board before the Sport Model's lower surface blazes amber, the craft lifts silently from its struts, the hangar doors somehow open of their own accord, and the Nevada sky is briefly visible before — with no transition, no sensation of movement, no sound — you are ELSEWHERE. The amber-violet sky of Zeta Reticuli arches overhead. Two suns. You made it.

[sport_model_launch_moon]
# Sport Model craft launches to Moon Base Alpha
object_id = sport_model_controls
state = destination_moon
location_has_property = contains_sport_model
requires_object = energized_115
requires_object_2 = alien_power_cell
turns_required = 1
new_state = in_transit
new_location = moon_base_alpha
message = With the energized Element 115 core seated and the power cell activated, you program Moon Base Alpha - Crater Tycho into the navigation console. The Sport Model responds with the same voiceless authority it always shows. Lift. Transit. The Moon's cratered surface materializes beyond the viewport. Tycho Crater. You are 239,000 miles from Earth. You can see it through the viewport as you descend toward the base's landing bay — blue, white, fragile, home.

[primary_craft_launch]
# Primary alien craft at Level 3 launches when navigation console is activated with full power
object_id = navigation_console
state = activated
location_has_property = has_navigation_console
requires_object = energized_115
turns_required = 2
new_state = in_transit
new_location = zeta_reticuli_homeworld
message = The navigation console registers your intent before your hands fully make contact. The entire craft shudders once — not mechanically, organically — as if waking. The Element 115 core blazes to full output. The rock of Papoose Mountain above you becomes transparent in your vision, then irrelevant. The craft is not bound by the mountain. The craft is not bound by anything. One moment you are 600 feet underground in Nevada. The next moment the amber-violet sky of a world 39 light-years away is everywhere, overwhelming, real.

[saucer_return_home]
# Any saucer can return from remote destination
object_id = sport_model_controls
state = remote_location
turns_required = 1
new_location = hangar_18
message = You activate the return course. The craft lifts. The alien sky ripples. And with that characteristic non-transition — that absence of movement that IS movement — Nevada reasserts itself. The desert. The mountain. Hangar 18. Home. Relative term, that.

[translator_activation]
# Reticulan translator activates after extended use
object_id = reticulan_translator
state = inactive
turns_required = 10
new_state = active
new_object_id = reticulan_translator
message = The translator has calibrated to the alien script in this environment. It now produces accurate English translations of Reticulan text when pressed against written material. As a side effect of extended use, you notice you are beginning to read some simple alien symbols directly, without the device. This is not alarming. It may be the most important thing that has ever happened to you.

[translator_direct_read]
# Extended translator use leads to direct reading ability
object_id = reticulan_translator
state = active
turns_required = 30
new_state = integrated
new_object_id = reticulan_translator
message = Something shifts. You look at the alien symbols flowing on the wall beside you — the constant status updates, environmental readouts, communication fragments — and you READ them. Not translate. Read. As naturally as you read English. The translator in your hand is now redundant. You set it down. The symbols say: SYSTEM NOMINAL. OCCUPANT INTEGRATION: COMPLETE. AWAIT FINAL ALIGNMENT. You understand all of this. That is extraordinary.

[gravity_emitter_power]
# Gravity wave emitter powers up when power cell is inserted
object_id = gravity_wave_emitter
state = unpowered
requires_object = alien_power_cell
turns_required = 1
new_state = powered
new_object_id = gravity_wave_emitter
message = The power cell slots into the gravity wave emitter with a click that sounds manufactured and a pulse of amber light that does not. The device hums to life in your hand, its activation surface warming. The gravitational distortion it emits is immediately perceptible — small objects nearby shift slightly, as if uncertain of the direction of down. The weapon is ready.

[plasma_rifle_power]
# Plasma rifle powers up when power cell inserted
object_id = plasma_rifle
state = unpowered
requires_object = alien_power_cell
turns_required = 1
new_state = powered
new_object_id = plasma_rifle
message = The power cell charges the plasma rifle with a rising tone — almost musical — as the plasma containment chamber fills. A readout on the rifle's side, in alien script, confirms CHARGE COMPLETE. The rifle is hot, ready, and if the theoretical physics work out, capable of outputting roughly the same energy as a small lightning strike. Point carefully.

[element115_drink_effect]
# Drinking Element 115 BOOST begins translator effect
object_id = element115_energy_drink
state = full
turns_required = 3
new_state = effect_active
new_object_id = element115_energy_drink
message = Approximately twenty minutes after drinking the Element 115 BOOST, something shifts. The alien script on the walls — the constant flowing symbols you've been seeing since Level 1 — resolves slightly. Not into English. Into something between. You can sense the meaning without fully reading the words. You are being prepared for something. You are not sure if that is reassuring.

[alien_food_effect]
# Alien food cube enhances translator sensitivity
object_id = alien_food_cube
state = whole
turns_required = 4
new_state = effect_active
new_object_id = alien_food_cube
message = The alien food cube's effects become apparent over the following turns. Your visual processing subtly recalibrates. Colors you haven't noticed before become vivid. The alien script becomes marginally clearer. Your sense of the gravitational distortion in the room sharpens — you can feel where the Element 115 reactor is without looking, a distant warm pull in a direction that isn't quite down.

[MIB_arrival]
# Men in Black arrive if player spends too many turns on surface
object_id = security_keycard
state = used
location_has_property = exterior
turns_required = 15
new_state = compromised
new_object_id = security_keycard
message = The distant sound of tires on gravel. A black SUV with no plates is moving across the dry lake bed toward your position at considerable speed. Another follows it. Men in Black — the actual government variety, not the mythology — have been alerted to your presence. They are not here to chat. You have approximately three turns before they reach your location. Going underground would be advised.

[biohazard_lock_bypass]
# Specimen storage biohazard lock can be bypassed with omega clearance badge
object_id = sample_container
state = sealed
requires_object = omega_clearance_badge
turns_required = 2
new_state = open
new_object_id = sample_container
message = The omega clearance badge registers on the biohazard lock's reader. A soft beep, a series of mechanical releases, and the specimen storage door slides open. Cold air flows out — the kind of deep cold that preserves things in states beyond death. The containers are inside. Most are sealed. Two are open and empty. Something that was kept here is no longer here. You note this with the specific calm of someone who has run out of room for new fear.
