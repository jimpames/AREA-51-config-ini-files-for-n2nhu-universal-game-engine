[entrance_hall]
name = Entrance Hall
description = You stand in the stark entrance hall of Area 51's main administration building. Fluorescent lights hum overhead. A large US Air Force seal is bolted to the concrete wall beside a sign that reads: RESTRICTED INSTALLATION - AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY. The air smells of industrial cleaner and something else - something electric and strange that drifts in from deeper in the complex. A front desk sits unmanned, a half-finished coffee going cold on it. To the south lies Groom Lake itself, the vast Nevada desert stretching to the horizon. To the east the compound opens up - hangars, tarmac, mysteries.
south = dry_lake_bed
east = administration_building

# ============================================================

[dry_lake_bed]
name = Groom Lake Dry Lake Bed
description = The vast, cracked expanse of Groom Lake stretches before you. The white alkali flats shimmer in the brutal Nevada sun. In the distance, chain-link fencing topped with razor wire marks the boundary of the most classified military installation on Earth. Security cameras sweep the perimeter. Warning signs read: USE OF DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED. To the east, the base proper begins. Tire tracks in the dust suggest heavy vehicle traffic. Overhead, a distant disc-shaped object glints briefly in the sunlight then vanishes.
north = entrance_hall
east = perimeter_gate
exterior = true

[perimeter_gate]
name = Perimeter Security Gate
description = The outer gate bristles with sensors, cameras, and armed checkpoints. A guardhouse sits behind reinforced glass where stone-faced security personnel watch your every move. The inner compound is visible beyond — massive hangars, antenna arrays, and mysterious low buildings. A painted sign reads: WARNING - RESTRICTED AREA - NO PHOTOGRAPHY. Oddly, the guard booth is currently unmanned. Someone left a security keycard on the counter. Beyond the gate to the east is the administration complex. A dirt road leads south toward the base of the mountains, and north toward the dry lake.
north = dry_lake_bed
east = administration_building
west = mountain_pass
armed_sensors = true

[mountain_pass]
name = Papoose Mountain Pass
description = A rugged desert pass cutting through the Spring Mountains. From here you have an elevated view of the entire facility below. You can see Hangar 18 to the northeast — the enormous black structure that conspiracy theorists have speculated about for decades. Through binoculars found on a rock nearby, you can make out unusual aircraft shapes on the tarmac. Shadows fall early here as the sun dips behind the peaks. The air smells faintly of ozone and something you cannot identify. A narrow trail leads east back toward the perimeter.
east = perimeter_gate
high_ground = true

# ============================================================
# SURFACE LEVEL - ADMINISTRATION & HANGARS
# ============================================================

[administration_building]
name = Administration Building - Level S-1
description = A brutally functional government building, all fluorescent lighting and linoleum floors. Filing cabinets line the walls, most of them empty or cleared out in obvious haste. A bulletin board holds a laminated sheet titled PROJECT AQUARIUS STATUS — REDACTED. Computer terminals sit dark and cold. A corridor leads east to the main hangar complex. South leads to the security command center. The building smells of stale coffee, cigarette smoke, and institutional fear.
west = perimeter_gate
east = tarmac
south = security_command
north = mess_hall

[mess_hall]
name = Base Mess Hall
description = Long aluminum tables, uncomfortable chairs, and the ghost of ten thousand institutional meals. A coffee urn still gurgles on the counter — whoever left in a hurry left it running. Trays are stacked in the pass-through window. A corkboard holds a duty roster dated three weeks ago, every slot marked CLASSIFIED EXERCISE. Military-issue MRE packets are stacked in a corner. A vending machine hums, inexplicably stocked with alien-labeled energy drinks: ELEMENT 115 BOOST — DO NOT CONSUME UNLESS AUTHORIZED. The exit south leads to administration, north to the barracks.
south = administration_building
north = barracks
has_food = true

[barracks]
name = Security Personnel Barracks
description = Rows of metal bunk beds with military-tight sheets. Personal effects are notably absent — these quarters were swept clean. One footlocker was overlooked and sits slightly open. A window looks out across the tarmac toward Hangar 18, and in the predawn darkness you can see blue-white light pulsing rhythmically from under the massive hangar doors. The pulse has no rhythm you can name — it breathes rather than beats. South leads back to the mess hall. A fire exit leads west to the tarmac.
south = mess_hall
west = tarmac
has_lockers = true

[tarmac]
name = Main Tarmac & Flight Line
description = The massive concrete apron stretches in all directions. Stenciled directions on the ground point toward various hangars. Two experimental aircraft sit under tarps, their silhouettes wrong in ways that resist description. The air smells of JP-7 jet fuel and something else — sweet and electric, like ozone before a lightning strike but warmer. Hangar 18 dominates the western end of the tarmac, its massive blast doors cracked open just enough to spill that eerie blue-white light. Hangar S4 is north behind a separate fence. East leads back to barracks.
east = barracks
west = hangar_18_exterior
north = s4_fence_line
energized = true

[hangar_18_exterior]
name = Hangar 18 - Exterior
description = Up close, Hangar 18 is enormous — large enough to swallow a football stadium. The black-painted steel walls radiate a subtle warmth despite the desert cold. The blast doors are cracked open approximately two feet, emitting that pulsing blue-white light and a low subsonic hum you feel in your molars rather than hear. The smell is overwhelming now — alien and electric, ancient and new simultaneously. Drag marks on the concrete tell a story of something very large being moved. Warning placards are posted in English, Russian, and a third script you don't recognize. East returns to the tarmac. Enter the hangar by squeezing through the blast doors.
east = tarmac
north = hangar_18
energized = true

[hangar_18]
name = Hangar 18 - Interior
description = HANGAR 18. The interior is cathedral-vast, lit by banks of industrial lighting that can't fully penetrate the shadows above. And there — in the center of the hangar, resting on a platform of unfamiliar composite material — is a craft. Not an aircraft. A disc. Roughly 30 feet across, charcoal-gray, with no visible seams, rivets, or external mechanisms. It seems to absorb light rather than reflect it except at its rim, which glows softly blue. Examination equipment is arrayed around it — spectrometers, Geiger counters, cameras on booms. Most equipment shows anomalous readings. The disc has a hatch. South returns outside. A stairway descends to Underground Level 1.
south = hangar_18_exterior
down = ul1_elevator_lobby
contains_disc = true
energized = true

[security_command]
name = Security Command Center
description = Banks of monitors display camera feeds from across the facility. Most feeds show empty corridors and dark rooms, but one monitor shows persistent static from Underground Level 3 — whatever is down there is interfering with electronics. A radio console crackles intermittently. A laminated EMERGENCY PROTOCOL card instructs personnel in the event of UNAUTHORIZED BIOLOGICAL CONTACT — the euphemism is not subtle. A weapons locker on the wall is locked but the glass is cracked. Security personnel rotation logs show a three-day gap starting seventy-two hours ago. North leads to administration, east to a locked corridor requiring keycard access.
north = administration_building
east = classified_corridor
requires_keycard = true

[classified_corridor]
name = Classified Research Corridor - Level S-2
description = A long white corridor with sealed doors bearing classification markings you've never seen before: COSMIC TOP SECRET, MAJIC EYES ONLY. The fluorescent lighting flickers in a pattern that seems almost intentional. Several doors are welded shut from the outside — a detail that raises disturbing questions. One door at the end of the corridor stands open: the briefing room used for Project READ-IN sessions. The walls are thick enough to be lead-lined. West returns to security command, east to the main briefing room, south to the S4 hangar complex access elevator.
west = security_command
east = briefing_room
south = s4_hangar_bay
requires_keycard = true

[briefing_room]
name = MJ-12 Briefing Room
description = A wood-paneled room that feels out of place in this utilitarian facility — clearly designed for high-level visitors. A projection screen is still deployed at the front of the room. The projector is off, but a slide carousel is loaded. A pointer leans against the wall. At the head of the table sits a briefing binder stamped MAJESTIC 12 — FOR PRESIDENTIAL EYES ONLY across every page in red ink. Most pages have been physically removed, but several remain, their content equal parts chilling and extraordinary. The room contains a potted plant, somehow still alive, which seems statistically impossible given everything else. West leads back down the corridor.
west = classified_corridor

[s4_fence_line]
name = S-4 Compound Fence Line
description = A second inner perimeter fence separates the S4 complex from the main base. Where Area 51 is classified, S4 feels like it exists in a category beyond classification. The signs here don't say DEADLY FORCE AUTHORIZED — they say nothing at all. That silence feels worse. Through the fence you can see Hangar S4 — built directly into the mountainside, with nine individual hangar bays carved from the rock. The sound from inside is not mechanical. It breathes. South returns to the tarmac. An access gate requires an S4 keycard.
south = tarmac
north = s4_hangar_bay
requires_s4_keycard = true

[s4_hangar_bay]
name = Hangar S4 - Bay 9
description = Bay 9 of the S4 facility is hewn directly from the rock of the Papoose Mountains. The walls are natural stone, but everything else is hyper-modern. A craft unlike the disc in Hangar 18 rests here — this one is larger, almost 60 feet across, with a profile that suggests athletic grace even at rest. This is what they call the Sport Model. It sits on struts that extend from its underside, and the entire lower surface glows with a gentle amber that pulses in harmony with a sound just below hearing. This craft has seen recent use — the struts show fresh ground contact marks. A console of alien design sits near the wall. Stairs in the rock descend to the underground labs.

contains_sport_model = true

# ============================================================
# UNDERGROUND LEVEL 1 - SECURITY & RESEARCH ADMINISTRATION
# ============================================================

[ul1_elevator_lobby]
name = Underground Level 1 - Elevator Lobby
description = The elevator opens onto a wide corridor illuminated by bioluminescent panels in the ceiling — not electrical lights, something grown. The walls are standard government construction down to about waist height, then transition seamlessly into something else — a composite material you cannot identify that feels warm to the touch and seems to respond faintly to contact. A directory on the wall lists nine levels underground. You are at Level 1. Security station to the north. Medical bay to the east. Specimen briefing room to the south. Elevator behind you leads up. A second elevator shaft, sealed and requiring special access, descends to Level 2.
up = hangar_18
north = ul1_security_station
east = ul1_medical_bay
south = ul1_specimen_briefing
down = ul2_access_point
bioluminescent = true

[ul1_security_station]
name = Underground Security Station
description = The underground security post is more heavily fortified than the surface command center. Blast-proof glass, redundant communications, and an armory that has been partially emptied — the weapons removed either by fleeing personnel or by something else. One security officer's personal effects remain: a photograph, a rosary, a half-eaten sandwich. The monitor showing Underground Level 3 shows only static here too, but occasionally a shape moves through the interference — something tall, angular, moving with liquid grace. South returns to the elevator lobby.
south = ul1_elevator_lobby

[ul1_medical_bay]
name = Medical Bay - Xenobiological Research Unit
description = The medical bay is unlike any hospital. Standard equipment shares space with instruments you cannot name — devices for measuring biological processes that human medicine has no names for. A surgical table is surrounded by articulated arms bearing scanners, each calibrated for anatomy that is not human. Case files are in binders on a shelf, heavily redacted, but the photographs at each file's front tell enough of the story. The subjects are not from here. Refrigerated specimen storage is through a sealed door to the north — currently sealed with a biohazard lock. West returns to the elevator lobby.
west = ul1_elevator_lobby
north = ul1_specimen_storage
biohazard_lock = true

[ul1_specimen_storage]
name = Xenobiological Specimen Storage
description = Rows of sealed cryogenic containers line the walls, each connected to monitoring equipment. Temperature readouts show -196°C. Most containers hold biological samples — tissue, organ analogs, biological materials for which no terrestrial taxonomy exists. But two containers near the back are large enough to hold a complete organism. Both containers are open. Both are empty. Whatever they held has been gone long enough for the interior frost to have partially sublimated — at least 72 hours. A faint bioluminescent handprint is on the wall beside the exit. The fingers are wrong. South returns to medical bay.
south = ul1_medical_bay
cold = true
empty_containers = true

[ul1_specimen_briefing]
name = Specimen Research Briefing Room
description = Where the MJ-12 room above was designed to impress, this room was designed to contain. Reinforced walls, one-way glass on two sides, an intercom system, and a conference table bolted to the floor. The one-way glass looks into two separate rooms — one appears to be a comfortable living space with a cot, food dispensers, and what appear to be artistic materials. The other room contains something that might be a communication console — alien design, covered in shifting symbols, currently dormant. The intercom crackles occasionally with static that sounds almost like language. North returns to the elevator lobby. East leads to the MJ-12 archives.
north = ul1_elevator_lobby
east = ul1_mj12_archives

[ul1_mj12_archives]
name = MJ-12 Archives - Document Vault
description = Floor to ceiling shelving holds decades of documents, photographs, artifacts, and recordings. The filing system is its own cryptography. Project names line the spines of binders: AQUARIUS, SIGMA, SNOWBIRD, GRUDGE, BLUEBOOK, MAJIC. A reading table holds several open files — someone was studying them recently. The photographs in the open files show craft at various stages of examination going back to 1947. The final binder in the series is labeled PROJECT GALILEO and contains a document titled INTERSTELLAR PROPULSION — ELEMENT 115 GRAVITIC MECHANISMS — working notes in two different handwriting styles. One handwriting is human. The other is not. West returns to briefing room.
west = ul1_specimen_briefing

[ul2_access_point]
name = Level 2 Access Control Point
description = The sealed elevator to Level 2 requires biometric clearance — retinal scan and palm print. The scanner's display reads AUTHORIZATION REQUIRED - LEVEL OMEGA CLEARANCE. However, the elevator door is not fully closed — it has been wedged open approximately four inches with what appears to be an alien artifact jammed in the door track. Something came up from below and apparently wanted to ensure the path remained open. The buzzing from the gap in the elevator door is not electrical. It is biological. Up leads back to Level 1.
up = ul1_elevator_lobby
down = ul2_reactor_corridor
wedged_open = true

# ============================================================
# UNDERGROUND LEVEL 2 - PROPULSION & RESEARCH LABS
# ============================================================

[ul2_reactor_corridor]
name = Underground Level 2 - Reactor Access Corridor
description = The moment the elevator opens you feel it — a resonance in your chest, your teeth, your vision. Everything at this level operates at a frequency slightly different from the world above. The corridor here glows amber from panels in the floor — not electricity, not bioluminescence, but something radiating from the material itself. The walls are entirely alien-composite now, no government construction remaining. Symbols flow along the wall surfaces in slowly shifting patterns — status readouts, you eventually realize. The reactor is west. The propulsion laboratory is east. The biology laboratories are south. The alien crew quarters are north.
up = ul2_access_point
west = ul2_element115_reactor

south = ul2_biology_lab
north = ul2_crew_quarters
energized = true

[ul2_element115_reactor]
name = Element 115 Reactor Chamber
description = The heart of everything. The reactor is a truncated pyramid approximately eight feet tall, constructed from a material that seems to exist in multiple states simultaneously — solid enough to touch but with a quality of impermanence, as if it could decide to be somewhere else. At its apex, a containment cradle holds a sample of Element 115 — Moscovium — but not the trace quantities Earth physics labs work with. This sample is the size of a grapefruit, a deep amber-orange, and it pulses with its own slow light. It is not radioactive in any way your Geiger counter can measure. It operates on gravity waves, converting Element 115's decay into a controlled gravitational distortion that powers every system on this level. The reactor cradle has an interface slot. East returns to the main corridor.
east = ul2_reactor_corridor
contains_reactor = true
energized = true
resonance = true
gravity_distortion = true

[ul2_propulsion_lab]
name = Alien Propulsion Research Laboratory
description = The largest space on Level 2. Workbenches line the walls, covered with disassembled alien technology at various stages of reverse-engineering. Human tools sit beside alien tools — the contrast is almost comical. Diagrams cover every wall: gravitational lensing models, space-time distortion calculations, force field topology maps. A scale model of the Sport Model craft sits on a central table, partially disassembled, showing its internal architecture — three amplifier discs stacked vertically in the craft's center column, fed by tubes from the reactor analog in the model's core. A large display screen on the eastern wall shows a slowly rotating three-dimensional star map. Your solar system is marked. Another system, 39 light-years distant, is circled in amber. West returns to the main corridor.
west = ul2_reactor_corridor
has_star_map = true

[ul2_biology_lab]
name = Xenobiology Research Laboratory
description = The biology lab has a quality of reverence — or perhaps apology — in its arrangement. The examination tables are surrounded by instruments calibrated with extraordinary care. Published research papers from Earth scientists sit beside handwritten notes in alien script. A display case holds biological comparatives: human anatomy diagram beside alien anatomy diagram. The differences are substantial, the similarities haunting. One workbench holds something remarkable: a sample of alien biological material in a containment vessel, still active — cells dividing under the microscope, following patterns that Earth biology has no framework to describe. A bioluminescent culture in a sealed tank on the south wall provides soft blue-green light. North returns to the main corridor.
north = ul2_reactor_corridor
bioluminescent = true

[ul2_crew_quarters]
name = Alien Crew Quarters
description = Small by human standards, these quarters are exquisitely engineered. Each sleeping area is an alcove barely large enough for the occupant, contoured to a body shape that is close to human but not quite — the proportions different, the surface materials of the built-in furniture calibrated for a different sensory range. Personal effects are present: objects that serve some function you cannot determine, what appear to be artistic works in media you have no names for, and communication devices — small flat objects that activate at touch with displays of shifting alien script. One alcove holds a document of some kind, the pages of a material thinner than paper but seemingly indestructible. Some pages appear to be a star chart. Some appear to be something like a journal. South returns to the main corridor.
south = ul2_reactor_corridor
contains_journal = true

# UNDERGROUND LEVEL 3 - CRAFT INTERIOR & COMMAND
# ============================================================

[ul3_boarding_ramp]
name = Underground Level 3 - Boarding Ramp
description = Level 3 is essentially a landing bay carved from the deepest rock of Papoose Mountain. The ceiling is 80 feet up, and the central feature is the primary craft — larger than anything in the hangars above, a true interstellar vessel of some kind, its hull showing evidence of enormous distances traveled. A boarding ramp extends from the craft's ventral section, its surface warm to the touch. The light here is entirely alien — no human electrical systems function reliably at this depth. Your flashlight flickers. Electronics behave strangely. But your eyes adapt, because the craft itself provides ambient light from its hull. The ramp leads up into the craft. Stairs lead back up to Level 2.
up = ul2_reactor_corridor
north = ul3_craft_entry
resonance = true
energized = true
electronics_disrupted = true

[ul3_craft_entry]
name = Alien Craft - Entry Chamber
description = Inside the craft, the architecture follows principles that differ from anything in human construction. There are no corners — all surfaces curve into each other. There are no visible fasteners, seams, or assembly points. The entire interior appears grown rather than built. A central column rises from floor to ceiling, softly luminous, pulsing at that frequency you feel rather than hear. Symbols flow along every surface — the same writing system as the rest of the facility but denser here, more urgent. An inner corridor curves both left and right, following the craft's rim. Ahead, the corridor leads to what must be the craft's center: the control room. The boarding ramp is behind you.
south = ul3_boarding_ramp
north = ul3_navigation_chamber
west = ul3_engineering_ring
east = ul3_crew_ring

[ul3_navigation_chamber]
name = Alien Craft - Navigation and Control Room
description = The navigation chamber occupies the center of the craft, directly above the central column. It is circular, approximately 20 feet across. Seven seats surround a central console that rises from the floor — each seat contoured for its occupant, the surfaces worn in patterns that speak of long use. The central console is active. It shows a three-dimensional display of local space — your solar system, nearby stars, nearby planets. One planet is marked in what you now recognize as the alien equivalent of a warning indicator. That planet is Earth. Above the central console, the ceiling has been made transparent, showing the raw rock of the mountain above — and something more. A section of ceiling shows not the rock, but stars. Deep space. The navigation console has an activation interface. Back leads to the entry chamber.
south = ul3_craft_entry
has_navigation_console = true
resonance = true

[ul3_engineering_ring]
name = Alien Craft - Engineering Ring
description = The left corridor from the entry leads to the engineering section of the craft — the ring-shaped maintenance space that encircles the central reactor column. Access panels in the floor and walls provide entry to the craft's internal systems. Several panels are open, their contents studied, some components partially removed for examination. But the craft has adapted — new components, grown from the living hull material, have replaced what was taken. The reactor for this craft is larger than the facility's external reactor, fed directly by a massive Element 115 core housed in a magnetic containment field in the floor's center. The core is currently at 40%% capacity. A readout in alien script, which you are beginning to intuitively understand after extended exposure, says something like AWAITING IGNITION. Back leads to the entry chamber.
east = ul3_craft_entry
contains_main_reactor = true
energized = true
reactor_charge = 40

[ul3_crew_ring]
name = Alien Craft - Crew Ring
description = The right corridor from the entry leads to the inhabited ring of the craft — crew spaces, communications, and what appears to be a medical suite using technology so far beyond the human medical bay above that comparison is meaningless. A communications console along the outer wall is active, displaying a signal — something broadcasting from outside the solar system, a slow, repeating pattern. The pattern has been analyzed: there is a human translation pinned beside the console, written in three different hands over what appear to be years of collaborative work. The translation reads: WE ARE COMING. WE WILL ARRIVE AT THE APPOINTED ALIGNMENT. PREPARE THE LANDING COORDINATES. The message is not a warning. It is a schedule. Back leads to the entry chamber.

has_communication_console = true

# TELEPORT DESTINATIONS (Reached via Flying Saucer Launch)
# ============================================================

[zeta_reticuli_homeworld]
name = Zeta Reticuli - Homeworld Surface
description = The flying saucer materializes without transit — one moment Nevada, the next HERE. The sky is a deep amber-violet, lit by two suns in a slow binary dance. The gravity is lighter — you feel it immediately, your movements too large, too buoyant. The landscape is ancient in a way Earth is not — a civilization that has outlasted geological epochs. Structures rise from the terrain that are grown rather than built, biological architecture on a city scale. You are standing in what appears to be a reception area — the grass, if it is grass, arranged in patterns that suggest intention. A Reticulan figure stands at a respectful distance, watching you with enormous dark eyes. It makes no threatening gesture. It holds out something: a small amber object that pulses with the same frequency as the Element 115 reactor. The saucer is behind you. It can take you back.
south = hangar_18
exterior = true
alien_world = true

[moon_base_alpha]
name = Moon Base Alpha - Crater Tycho
description = The saucer emerges on the lunar surface in a pressurized bay carved into the rim of Tycho Crater. Through reinforced viewport panels: Earth hanging in a black sky, blue and heartbreaking and impossibly far. The base is human in origin but alien in refinement — the original American construction evident in early components, but everything has been modified, extended, improved by the application of alien technology. Gravity plating keeps you on the floor at roughly Earth normal. A crew of mixed human and Reticulan personnel move through the corridors with the ease of long familiarity. A base commander — human, military, the kind of permanent tan that comes from decades of off-world deployment — approaches you. His eyes are the specific flat gray of someone who has seen too much to be surprised by anything. He says: We wondered when you'd make it this far. A saucer bay holds a craft that can return to Groom Lake. Deeper into the base is the quantum communications array — the device that has been coordinating activities between here, Zeta Reticuli, and Earth for thirty years.
south = hangar_18
north = quantum_comm_array

[quantum_comm_array]
name = Moon Base Alpha - Quantum Communications Array
description = The most sophisticated communications installation in the known solar system. Quantum-entangled transceivers link this station instantaneously with the homeworld — no signal delay, no signal intercept possible. The displays show an active conversation, text scrolling in that alien script you've grown to read. The subject is Earth. The subject is you. The subject is the appointed alignment — a date in the very near future when the orbital mechanics of multiple solar systems will create a navigational window. The human technician at the console turns to you. She doesn't look surprised. She says: You read Reticulan. That's new. Then, more quietly: That means the exposure worked as intended. You're not just a visitor anymore. South returns to the main base.
