[grey_alien_template]
type = sprite
name = Reticulan Grey
description = A Reticulan — the species humans call Grey aliens. Approximately 4.5 feet tall, with a large cranium, enormous black almond-shaped eyes that reflect light like obsidian, a vestigial nose, and a slit for a mouth. The skin is pale grey-green, slightly luminescent in low light. It wears a close-fitted garment of alien composite material. It communicates telepathically — you perceive its intent rather than hear its words, a sensation like thoughts arriving fully-formed. It regards you with an expression that contains curiosity, wariness, and something that might be compassion if compassion could be ancient.

[hostile_grey_template]
type = sprite
name = agitated Reticulan
description = A Reticulan Grey in a state of alert — the large black eyes focused with intensity, the bioluminescent skin pulsing in rapid patterns that the translator tells you means danger or defense. It has produced a ZAT-style disruptor from somewhere on its person and holds it with practiced ease. It is not attacking — yet — but its body language (translated by your growing intuition) says: leave, or this becomes something else.

[reptilian_template]
type = sprite
name = Reptilian security entity
description = Taller than a human — perhaps 6.5 feet — with a broad, heavy build and scales of deep iridescent green-black. The eyes are amber with vertical pupils, the posture upright but with an economy of movement that suggests lethal capability held in reserve. This is not the collaborative species you've encountered in the crew quarters. This entity is security — the muscle of an interstellar operation, and it has identified you as an unauthorized presence. The sound it makes is subsonic, felt in the chest.

[reptilian_commander_template]
type = sprite
name = Reptilian Commander
description = The most physically imposing entity you have encountered. Over 7 feet, with scarring on its scales that speak of combat across worlds. This is the security commander of the primary craft — the entity responsible for the defense of the interstellar mission. It carries a larger variant of the plasma weapon and wears armor plating over the natural scale armor. It communicates not telepathically but directly — a subsonic transmission that you feel as language in your sternum. It is not surprised to see you. It has been waiting.

[reticulan_ambassador_template]
type = sprite
name = Reticulan Ambassador
description = This Reticulan carries itself differently from the others — the posture of authority rather than science, the sense of deliberate purpose. This is a diplomat. Its garment has additional markings, its movements are precise and considered. When it communicates telepathically, the transmission is clearer than the others — it has more practice reaching across the species gap. It does not appear hostile. It appears to have been expecting you, specifically, for a very long time.

# GOVERNMENT / HUMAN THREATS
# ============================================================

[mib_agent_template]
type = sprite
name = Men in Black agent
description = Government issue from head to foot — black suit (always the suit), dark glasses (always the glasses), an expression of absolute bureaucratic authority that has never been softened by doubt. Armed with standard federal sidearm plus something longer under the jacket that is definitely not standard issue. These are the people who make people forget things they saw. They are not here to make you forget. They are here because you went past the forgetting stage forty-five minutes ago.

[mib_senior_agent_template]
type = sprite
name = Senior MIB operative
description = More senior, less human-looking in the functional-robot sense. This one has clearance you don't have and never will have by conventional means. Carries a device that your translator identifies as a neuralytic scrambler — the thing that produces selective amnesia. Also carries a full automatic weapon and the practiced calm of someone who has done whatever this is many, many times.
health = 100

takeable = false

[security_drone_template]
type = sprite
name = automated security drone
description = About the size of a basketball, matte black, with a hovering mechanism you cannot identify — no rotors, no visible thrust. It patrols corridors silently at roughly head height. When it detects an unauthorized presence, a targeting ring emerges from its underside and it emits a high-pitched tone that escalates in frequency with proximity. Contact with the drone is not recommended. It appears to incorporate alien technology into a human-designed housing — the AI behavior is too fluid to be entirely military software.
health = 40

[security_guard_template]
type = sprite
name = base security guard
description = Regular military security personnel — human, armed, doing their job. Many of these individuals are not fully aware of what this base contains. They know it is extremely classified. They know they are to stop unauthorized persons by whatever means necessary. They are not the enemy in any philosophical sense. They are, however, currently very much in your way.

# ============================================================
# BOSS ENTITIES
# ============================================================

[alien_hive_mind_template]
type = sprite
name = the Collective Voice
description = Not a single entity — a distributed consciousness that the translator renders as a single voice. It manifests visually as a pulsing amber ovoid of light approximately the size of a person, sustained by continuous low-level gravitational wave emission. It is the governing intelligence of the mission on Earth — what the Reticulan workers report to, what the Reptilian Commander defers to, what the documents in the MJ-12 archives refer to obliquely as THE AUTHORITY. It has been aware of you since you crossed the perimeter fence. It allowed you to come this far. It has things it needs to say.

[base_commander_template]
type = sprite
name = Base Commander
description = The human commander of the facility — the person who answers to nobody except the twelve. Tall, severe, with the specific thousand-yard stare of decades of total immersion in classified reality. Armed with a custom weapon and the authority to activate facility-wide lockdown. He is not, technically, hostile — he is, technically, in charge of a situation that left his operational parameters behind the moment you got past the surface. He looks at you with something that might be relief.
