[security_keycard]
name = security keycard
description = A standard government-issue proximity card, laminated, with GROOM LAKE SECURITY LEVEL S-1 printed on its face. The magnetic strip is intact. It will open the classified corridor from the security command center.
location = perimeter_gate
takeable = true
keycard_level = s1
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use

[s4_keycard]
name = S-4 compound keycard
description = A matte black card with no printing whatsoever — no agency name, no employee ID, no classification marking. Just a black card. The S4 compound uses these for access. The absence of identification IS the identification.
location = barracks
takeable = true
keycard_level = s4
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use

[omega_clearance_badge]
name = OMEGA clearance badge
description = A biometric badge combining retinal data, palm geometry, and a quantum-encrypted chip. Required for Level 2 underground access. It was found in the specimen briefing room, left behind by someone who left in a very great hurry.
location = ul1_specimen_briefing

# ELEMENT 115 & POWER ITEMS
# ============================================================

[element_115_sample]
name = Element 115 sample
description = A piece of Moscovium — Element 115 on the Periodic Table — approximately the size of a golf ball. On Earth it is synthesized in particle accelerators in microgram quantities. This sample weighs roughly 200 grams. It is a deep amber-orange, slightly warm to the touch, and emits a slow visible pulse of amber light. Your Geiger counter shows nothing — it does not decay in any conventional radiological sense. What it does do is subtly but perceptibly distort gravity in its immediate vicinity. Objects near it weigh slightly less. Your footsteps near it sound different. It IS different.
location = ul2_element115_reactor
takeable = true
state = inert
energized = false
gravity_source = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, insert

[energized_115]
name = energized Element 115 core
description = An Element 115 sample that has been activated through the reactor interface. The amber pulse is now rapid and intense, and the gravitational distortion around it is unmistakable — your hand near it feels the pull, not toward the sample, but UPWARD, toward open space, as if the sample knows where it came from. It is now capable of powering alien technology. Handle with care: the gravitational waves it emits will interfere with any conventional electronics within two meters.
location = none

valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, insert

[alien_power_cell]
name = alien power cell
description = A flattened oval object approximately the size of a deck of cards, made from the same composite material as the facility walls. One face is textured with a grid of raised nodes; the other face is smooth with a faintly glowing amber vein running through it like circuitry. When you hold it, it pulses in sync with your heartbeat within about thirty seconds — some kind of adaptive calibration. It is a power source. For alien technology. It holds what feels like a very significant amount of charge.
location = ul2_propulsion_lab
takeable = true
state = charged
charge_level = full
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, insert

[depleted_power_cell]
name = depleted power cell
description = An alien power cell that has been fully discharged. The amber vein is dark. The nodes are cold. It no longer pulses. It is not useless — it can be recharged by the Element 115 reactor — but in its current state it is inert.
location = none
takeable = true
state = depleted
charge_level = empty
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, insert

[gravity_wave_emitter]
name = gravity wave emitter
description = A handheld device roughly 8 inches long, alien construction, with a slightly curved profile that fits naturally in a human hand despite not being designed for one. One end focuses; the other end has a single activation surface. When powered, it projects a focused gravitational distortion beam. Uses: moving heavy objects without touching them, disrupting enemy balance, potentially interfacing with gravity-based alien systems. Currently requires a power cell to function.
location = ul2_propulsion_lab
takeable = true
weapon = true
damage = 35
requires_power = true
powered = false
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, attack, insert

[antigravity_disc]
name = anti-gravity disc
description = A flat circular disc about 8 inches across, clearly a component removed from one of the craft for analysis. It hums very faintly at all times. When activated via the raised activation point on its surface, it generates an anti-gravity field roughly 3 feet in radius. Within that field, objects float. This includes the user. Powered by alien power cells. Extremely useful for reaching high places or, apparently, simply for the extraordinary experience of floating in a cavern 300 feet underground while two suns-worth of theoretical physics hum beneath your feet.
location = ul2_propulsion_lab
takeable = true
state = inactive
requires_power = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, activate

[reticulan_translator]
name = Reticulan translator
description = A small device — flat, organic in feel, with a surface that responds to alien script placed against it. After approximately sixty seconds of exposure to alien text, it begins producing a phonetic approximation in English. After thirty minutes of cumulative use it produces accurate translations. After sixty minutes something else happens: you begin reading the alien script directly, without the device. The translator does not explain this. The effect does not reverse.

[mj12_briefing_binder]
name = MJ-12 briefing binder
description = Stamped MAJESTIC 12 - FOR PRESIDENTIAL EYES ONLY on every remaining page. Most pages have been removed. What remains: an organizational chart showing twelve names above a line labeled FOUNDING MEMBERS — all redacted except one, which reads FORRESTAL (deceased). A timeline of recovery operations from 1947 to present. A section titled BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES - SUMMARY, which contains one legible sentence: They came here on purpose.
location = briefing_room
takeable = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, read, use

[project_galileo_notes]
name = Project GALILEO working notes
description = A research binder from the MJ-12 archives. Two distinct handwriting styles throughout: one human (identified in margin as Dr. R. Lazar, Physics Dept), one alien. Yes, alien. The handwriting is in an adapted human script but the letter formation is wrong in ways that suggest a hand with different joints. The content is the theoretical physics of Element 115 gravitational wave propulsion. The human notes ask questions. The alien notes provide answers. The collaboration is dated over a period of three years. The final pages are a flight manual for the Sport Model craft. In both languages.
location = ul1_mj12_archives
takeable = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, read, use

[alien_journal]
name = alien crew journal
description = From the crew quarters. Pages of material thinner than paper, covered in alien script. After using the translator for a while, you can read it. It is a personal account of the mission. The author writes about their homeworld — two suns, amber skies — with the particular brevity of someone who assumes they will return. Near the end, the writing changes character: faster, less careful. The final entries discuss the accident. The crash. And then what came after. The humans who came. The long negotiation. The strange and surprisingly functional partnership that emerged. The final entry says something like: They are not ready. But they are becoming ready. I think we are running out of time to wait for them.
location = ul2_crew_quarters
takeable = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, read, use

[star_map]
name = stellar navigation chart
description = A three-dimensional chart on a material that maintains its topology when handled — it folds and unfolds to show different scales of the same data. At large scale: the local galactic neighborhood, 100 light-years, with visited systems marked. At medium scale: the approach corridor to this solar system, with gravitational waypoints marked for navigation efficiency. At close scale: your solar system, with three installations marked — Groom Lake, Moon Base Tycho, and a third location in the asteroid belt you didn't know about. The chart is clearly a working navigation tool. It has been marked up, updated, corrected. It is genuinely priceless as an intelligence document.
location = ul2_crew_quarters
takeable = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, read, use

[base_schematic]
name = Area 51 facility schematic
description = A complete technical diagram of the underground facility — all nine levels, though only the top three are shown in your version. The lower levels are marked with symbols you can't yet read, but the translator is working on it. Useful immediately for navigation and for identifying which access points are still open.
location = administration_building
takeable = true

[zat_pistol]
name = ZAT disruptor pistol
description = A sidearm of alien manufacture, approximately the size of a large handgun, but contoured and smooth with no visible action, slide, or barrel in the conventional sense. A single activation surface on the grip fires the weapon. The effect is a focused electromagnetic-gravitational pulse — first shot stuns and incapacitates, second shot is lethal, third shot disintegrates. The weapon has markings that suggest it was assigned to a specific individual — someone who is no longer present.
location = ul1_security_station
takeable = true
weapon = true
damage = 45
stun_mode = true
disintegrate_mode = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, attack

[plasma_rifle]
name = Reticulan plasma rifle
description = A long-arm alien weapon, shoulder-fired, with a power cell slot visible on its lower surface. Fires superheated plasma at range — effective against both biological targets and electronic systems. Two settings: a narrow, penetrating beam and a wider cone of suppressive fire. The stock is designed for a slightly different shoulder configuration but is usable by a human with minor adjustment. Currently unloaded — needs a power cell.
location = s4_hangar_bay
takeable = true
weapon = true
damage = 60
requires_power = true
powered = false
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, attack, insert

[military_pistol]
name = security force M9 pistol
description = A standard US military Beretta M9, 9mm. Mundane but reliable. Twelve rounds remaining in the magazine. This is the most human object you have found in some time and the familiarity is almost jarring.
location = ul1_security_station
takeable = true
weapon = true
damage = 20
ammo = 12
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, attack

[mk3_stun_grenade]
name = MK3 stun grenade
description = A standard military flashbang grenade. Effective at temporarily incapacitating humans. Notably less effective against beings who experience light and sound through different sensory mechanisms. Use with appropriate expectations.
location = classified_corridor
takeable = true

[radiation_suit]
name = full radiation isolation suit
description = A sealed positive-pressure suit rated for radiological, biological, and chemical hazards. Not originally designed for the specific ambient energies of alien technology, but the lead-lined inner layer provides some shielding from gravitational wave interference. Wearing this will reduce the translator exposure effect and protect you from the more aggressive forms of alien bioenergy radiation. A tradeoff you may or may not want to make.
location = ul1_medical_bay
takeable = true
wearable = true
worn = false
protection = radiation
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use, wear

[geiger_counter]
name = Geiger counter
description = A standard radiological survey instrument. Has been almost entirely useless throughout your time in this facility, as alien energy sources don't decay in patterns it can measure. Does react faintly and erratically near Element 115. Occasionally useful for detecting human-made contamination sources. Still running. Batteries presumably alien-charged.
location = hangar_18
takeable = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use

[binoculars]
name = military binoculars
description = High-quality military field binoculars, 10x50 magnification. Useful at the surface. Less useful underground. Left on a rock in the mountain pass by a surveillance team that apparently left in a hurry, like everyone else.
location = mountain_pass
takeable = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use

[flashlight]
name = tactical flashlight
description = A military-grade LED flashlight. Works perfectly on the surface and on Underground Level 1. Begins flickering on Level 2. Completely unreliable on Level 3 due to electromagnetic interference from the craft. In the craft itself, unnecessary — the craft provides its own light. Still, carry it.
location = administration_building
takeable = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use

[sample_container]
name = biological sample container
description = A sealed containment vessel for transporting biological specimens. Originally human-made, modified with alien materials to also contain xenobiological samples safely. Currently empty. Could be useful for collecting specimens.
location = ul1_medical_bay
takeable = true
container = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, open, close, use

# CONSUMABLES & ALIEN FOOD
# ============================================================

[element115_energy_drink]
name = Element 115 BOOST energy drink
description = Inexplicably stocked in the base vending machine. The label shows a stylized flying saucer over the words ELEMENT 115 BOOST - MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE - DO NOT CONSUME UNLESS AUTHORIZED. The liquid inside is amber-orange and slightly luminescent. It tastes like orange citrus, electricity, and a distant memory of somewhere else. Effect: significant energy restoration and, after about twenty minutes, a subtle but persistent sense that you can almost read the alien text on the walls. This is not a hallucination.
location = mess_hall
takeable = true
consumable = true
health_restore = 40
translator_boost = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, drink

[alien_food_cube]
name = alien nutritional cube
description = From the crew quarters. A dense cube of material approximately two inches on a side, pale amber, with a slightly fibrous interior. Alien food. After extended exposure to this facility your physiology has adapted enough — or your reluctance has broken down enough — to make consumption theoretically survivable. It tastes like nothing you have words for, and then for about ten minutes like the best thing you have ever eaten, which is cognitively disturbing. Restores significant health and energy. Side effect: alien script becomes slightly easier to read.
location = ul2_crew_quarters
takeable = true
consumable = true
health_restore = 50
translator_boost = true
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, eat

[mre_packet]
name = military MRE - Chicken Tetrazini
description = A standard military Meal Ready to Eat. Chicken Tetrazini. It tastes exactly as you'd expect. After everything you've experienced in this facility, the profound normality of an MRE is almost emotional. Restores modest health. No alien side effects whatsoever. You find this somehow reassuring.
location = mess_hall
takeable = true
consumable = true
health_restore = 15
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, eat

[full_coffee_urn]
name = full coffee urn (running)
description = The mess hall coffee urn. Still running. Still hot. Military-strength drip coffee, probably from early this morning. After everything, coffee. It is perfect. Restores moderate health and focus. You can refill from it multiple times.
location = mess_hall
takeable = false
consumable = true
health_restore = 20
refillable = true
valid_verbs = examine, drink, use

[alien_healing_compound]
name = alien regenerative compound
description = Found in the craft's medical suite. A small sealed vial containing a luminescent liquid in shifting shades of amber and blue. Alien medicine. The translation of its label — after extended work with the translator — reads something like CELLULAR RESTORATION COMPOUND — RETICULAN BIOLOGY. However, testing in the xenobiology lab has shown cross-species applicability. Effects in humans: rapid wound closure, inflammatory reduction, general physiological restoration. Effects beyond that are less documented. Restores substantial health.
location = ul3_crew_ring

[sport_model_controls]
name = Sport Model activation console
description = The alien console in S4 Hangar Bay 9, positioned near the Sport Model craft. It is clearly an external ground control interface — a remote activation and destination-programming console. Current destination is locked to a return course. However, with the Project GALILEO notes as a guide, other destinations can be programmed. Known programmable destinations: Zeta Reticuli Homeworld, Moon Base Alpha. To launch the Sport Model, you need an energized Element 115 core inserted into the reactor interface on the craft, and a charged power cell in the activation console.
location = s4_hangar_bay
takeable = false
console = true
requires_energized_115 = true
requires_power_cell = true
valid_verbs = examine, use, activate, insert

[navigation_console]
name = alien navigation console
description = The central navigation interface of the primary alien craft. A raised console with interaction surfaces calibrated for alien hands but usable. The three-dimensional space display above it shows real-time local space. The console accepts destination programming through a gesture interface or, apparently, through extended mental focus — the craft responds to intent at close range. Current status shows the craft has sufficient power for short-range travel within the solar system. For interstellar travel, full Element 115 charge is required.
location = ul3_navigation_chamber
takeable = false
console = true
requires_energized_115 = true
valid_verbs = examine, use, activate

[reactor_interface]
name = Element 115 reactor interface cradle
description = The containment cradle at the apex of the Level 2 reactor. Currently holds the large permanent Element 115 core. Smaller samples of Element 115 can be inserted here to be energized by the reactor field — like charging a battery. The interface slot is designed for the standard sample size recovered from the craft systems. Inserting an inert Element 115 sample into this cradle while the reactor is active will energize it within approximately 5 turns.
location = ul2_element115_reactor
takeable = false
cradle = true
valid_verbs = examine, use, insert

[alien_artifact_amber]
name = amber alien artifact
description = The small amber object offered to you by the Reticulan figure on the homeworld (if you've been there). It fits in the palm of your hand. It pulses. When you hold it and close your eyes, you can sense the gravity waves in the room — not see them, sense them, as a new organ you didn't have yesterday. It is a gift. Its specific function beyond that sense-enhancement is not yet clear. But gifts from an interstellar civilization probably deserve extended study.
location = zeta_reticuli_homeworld
takeable = true
state = gift
valid_verbs = take, drop, examine, use

[mj12_dead_drop]
name = MJ-12 dead drop envelope
description = A sealed envelope taped to the underside of the desk in the administration building — the classic intelligence tradecraft of a dead drop. Inside: a handwritten note, three photographs, and a USB drive. The note is from someone who signed with initials only: B.L. The photographs show the Sport Model craft from various angles, clearly taken from someone with close access. The note says: If you found this, you already know. The drive has everything. The drive is formatted for a system you would need to find. But it is a start.
